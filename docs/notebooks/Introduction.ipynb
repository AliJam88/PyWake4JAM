                "The never ending stream of publications concerning wind farm flows nicely demonstrates the difficulty we are still facing in accurately modelling the aerodynamic phenomena within wind energy. There is currently not a single accepted method that could possibly capture the extensive range of flow scales - from aerofoil boundary layer to farm-to-farm - especially not one that is sufficiently cheap to allow computing AEP. Engineering wind farm models present a reasonable balance between accuracy and costs for wind farm AEP simulations, yet they rely on multiple sub-models that need to be selected wisely according to the problem at hand. A certain model and parameter combination might work for one particular case but not another - as demonstrated in an endless number of published model comparisons/validations. PyWake's engineering wind farm models are therefore also completely modular, allowing to combine different single wake models with different superposition, blockage, turbulence and deflection models to simulate wind farm flows. Each respective model is also configurable and its parameters tunable.\n",
                "\n",
                "The sheer amount of possible sub-model combinations and settings can be overwhelming, so here some very general guidance for how to combine them and what choices to consider. Let's start with the selection of superposition model - here you mainly have to decide between `SquaredSum` or `LinearSum`. The former does not really have a clear physical foundation, but was found to give some promising results in deep-arrays, as it isolates the most severe deficits, much like `MaxSum`. Beware, though, that its successful application largely depends on how the deficits are calculated inside the farm. Depending on the control volume one considers, one could either use the wind farm free-stream wind speed even for turbines inside the array or if isolating individual turbines, the incoming wind speed at each turbine, which then includes the deficits from upstream turbines (and blockage from upstream/donwstream, if included). Whilst physically it is hard to argue for using the free-stream velocity inside the array - upstream turbines have taken energy out of the flow - one could choose to do so, however then it is imperative not to use `LinearSum`. PyWake uses the *effective wind speed* at each turbine to calculate the thrust, power and deficit, thus if the free-stream velocity is chosen as *effective wind speed*, then the deficits are extremely large even inside the array and the flow goes negative when simply summing them (`LinearSum`). A physically more consistent approach - in-line with using single wake models - is to use the incoming wind speed to the turbine as *effective wind speed* by setting `use_effective_ws=True`. The deficits should then be combined with the `LinearSum` - the `SquaredSum` actually leads to double counting (see Park2 model description for details). The `WeightedSum` approach by Zong et al is only available for Gaussian wake deficit models as of now and tends towards the `LinearSum` results. It is an iterative method with high memory requierements and only differs from the `LinearSum` when combining extremely deep deficits. It should individually be judged whether its benefits outweigh the additional costs. \n",
                "\n",
                "Another important selection is the wake deficit model. Here the general recommendation is to use a Gaussian type model. They are in fact faster than the top-hat model, momentum deficit conserving (in isolation) and avoid singular behaviour (step changes). The available Gaussian model versions differ in their formulation of their streamwise wake expansion, which is governed by the initial wake diameter (at the wake origin) and its rate of expansion with downstream distance. The expansion can be constant (pre-set by user) or based on the *effective turbulence intensity (TI)*. Increasing TI leads to greater mixing and thus quicker expansion/deficit attenuation (users can change the coefficients if desired). When using a turbulence model the wake added turbulence in a farm is combined and leads to spatially varying TI. As with the deficit, the user can choose to use the local TI at the rotor (`use_effective_ti=True`) or the free-stream TI. Whilst physically one might argue for using the local TI, this approach leads to excessive wake expansion deep inside the array when summing all contributions. The wake addded turbulence is overestimated and the free-stream TI seems the better reference to set the wake expansion. The reason lies in the simplistic representation of turbulence by a single figure, TI, and its connection to wake expansion. The free-stream TI describes the atmospheric turbulence and thus also the larger scales contributing to wake-meandering and wake breakdown. The wake-added turbulence is small scale and dissipates quicker, thus contributing differently to wake mixing. For this reason in Fuga and the DWM model only the free-stream TI governs wake expansion. One should also keep in mind that the Guassian wake shape is a time-averaged solution, that incorporates meandering, shear-layer breakdown and mixing without differentiating between them. \n",
                "Classically Gaussian models are far-wake models, so the near-wake is rather crude. Shapiro et al. introduced a smooth growth in the deficit, which also forms part of the Zong model. The latter also sets the initial wake diameter by the near-wake length to capture the effect of TI and tip speed ratio on near-wake breakdown and subsequent far-wake onset. Other near-wake updates exist, yet their value is limited in AEP computations as turbines are usually placed outside this region in wind farms.\n",
                "\n",
                "In PyWake it is possible to introduce a mirror plane to represent the ground effect - turbines are mirrored in the ground plane. This is a method commonly employed in vortex models, as it enforces zero wall-normal velocity. However, whilst for blockage models highly recommended, it is less obvious whether to use a mirror plane for wakes. Wake models are generally tuned to measurement or simulation data that intrinsically contain the ground effect - inroducing it, could lead to double counting. This is also the reason why the `groundModel` can be set seperately for blockage and wake models. \n",
                "\n",
                "Finally let's discuss the wind turbine model itself. PyWake uses power and CT curves, which can also be multi-dimensional (more suited to wind farm simulations), but necessarily need to be a function of the *free-stream* (reference) wind speed. In PyWake a turbine's blockage and wake effects on itself, as well as its own mirror contributions (performance curves already include the ground effect), are zero. Thus the wind speed at the rotor can be used to interpolate power and CT from the reference curves. The velocity at the rotor can be computed in different ways (`rotorAvgModel`), default is extracting the velocity at the rotor-centre, however one can also opt for more rotor-equivalent wind speed quantities. Yet, one should consider that a turbine's performance curves are usually generated by using the rotor-centre velocity. The wind speed used for interpolation and deficit computation are always identical. As the power and CT curves are non-linear users are advised to use higher-order splines in their interpolation (for instance `pchip`). A final issue relates to the often singular behaviour of power/thrust curves around cut-in and cut-out. Firstly, around those wind-speeds sudden jumps in production can occur as turbines are close to switch on/off, so even small changes in wind speed/direction can lead to strong relative changes. Secondly, in combination with blockage there is no definite solution, as some turbines might be on or off - either would be correct. This is mostly related to the downstream speed-up blockage can cause in addition to upstream deficit. In the `All2AllIterative` on/off oscillations are avoided by tracking unstable turbines and switching them all off. \n",
