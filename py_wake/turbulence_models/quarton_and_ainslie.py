    """The model described in the paper by Quarton and Ainslie (1990).

    The added turbulence intensity in the wake is described as an
    empirical function of the turbine thrust coefficient, the ambient
    turbulence intensity and the downstream distance normalised by the
    length of the near wake. The estimate of the near wake length is
    based upon an empirical calculation method proposed by Vermeulen and
    colleagues (see references above).

    The paper (Quarton and Ainslie, 1990) does not propose a method of
    predicting the variation in wake added turbulence intensity as a
    function of radial (cross-wind) distance from the wake centreline.
    In the implementation here, it is simply assumed the turbulence
    inside the wake is constant, and for a rotor partially inside the
    wake the result is weighted by the proportion of the area insider
    the wake radius. For Gaussian wake profiles that do not have a clear
    border, the radius should define where the conditions are
    substantially as in the freestream.

    For the modified version of the model later proposed by Hasan, see
    ``ModifiedQuartonAndAinslieTurbulenceModel``.
